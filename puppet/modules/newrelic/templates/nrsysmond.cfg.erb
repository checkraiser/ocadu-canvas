# Default: none
#
license_key=<%= license_key %>

# Option : loglevel
# Value  : Level of detail you want in the log file (as defined by the logfile
#          setting below. Valid values are (in increasing levels of verbosity):
#          error        - show errors only
#          warning      - show errors and warnings
#          info         - show minimal additional information messages
#          verbose      - show more detailed information messages
#          debug        - show debug messages
#          verbosedebug - show very detailed debug messages
loglevel=error

# Option : logfile
# Value  : Name of the file where the server monitor will store it's log
#          messages. The amount of detail stored in this file is controlled
#          by the loglevel option (above).
logfile=/var/log/newrelic/nrsysmond.log

# Option : ssl
# Value  : Whether or not to use the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for all
#          communication with the New Relic collector. Possible values are
#          true/on or false/off. In certain rare cases you may need to modify
#          the SSL certificates settings below.
ssl=true

# Option : ssl_ca_bundle
# Value  : The name of a PEM-encoded Certificate Authority (CA) bundle to use
#          for SSL connections. This very rarely needs to be set. The monitor
#          will attempt to find the bundle in the most common locations. If
#          you need to use SSL and the monitor is unable to locate a CA bundle
#          then either set this value or the ssl_ca_path option below.
# Default: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt or
#          /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
# Note   : Can also be set with the -b command line option.
#
#ssl_ca_bundle=/path/to/your/bundle.crt

# Option : ssl_ca_path
# Value  : If your SSL installation does not use CA bundles, but rather has a
#          directory with PEM-encoded Certificate Authority files, set this
#          option to the name of the directory that contains all the CA files.
# Default: /etc/ssl/certs
# Note   : Can also be set with the -S command line option.
#
#ssl_ca_path=/etc/ssl/certs


# Option : pidfile
# Value  : Name of a file where the server monitoring daemon will store it's
#          process ID (PID). This is used by the startup and shutdown script
#          to determine if the monitor is already running, and to start it up
#          or shut it down.
pidfile=/var/run/newrelic/nrsysmond.pid
